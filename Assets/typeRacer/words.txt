Riding into the sunset

Draw your six shooter

The sheriff is coming

Wanted Dead or Alive

Gold rush in Texas

Spurs jingle with pride

High noon showdown time

Whiskey at the saloon

Lasso that wild stallion

Tumbleweeds roll by slow

Dust settles on boots

The outlaw rides fast

Saddle up cowboy

Giddy up we ride

Campfire under the stars

The ranch needs fixing

Lost in the badlands

Gunpowder in the air

A lone rider watches

Card game turns deadly

Boots covered in dust

Bar fight getting rough

The cattle are restless

Desert heat beats down

The bandits are near

Rope that runaway steer

The train is coming

Storm rolling through town

The law rides tonight

A new sheriff arrives

Coyotes howling at dawn

Whiskey burns the throat

The posse rides fast

Smoke from the pistol

A hat tipped low

Horse gallops through town

Money for the bounty

Poker hand turns deadly

The bell tolls noon

A rattlesnake hisses loud

Rifles line the ridge

The frontier is harsh

Moonlight on the prairie

Rusted spurs on boots

Gunfight in the saloon

Thunder echoes through hills

Dust storm approaches fast

The blacksmith hammers steel

The river runs dry

The gang wants revenge

Cattle rustlers in sight

The desert takes all

Saddle leather creaks slow

A horse drinks deep

A cowboys last ride

The range calls again

Steady hands steady aim

The bartender pours slow

Hoofbeats shake the ground

The canyon hides secrets

Lonely trails stretch far

A boot print in mud

The wind whispers low

A duel at dawn

Tied up in the barn

The lonesome rider waits

A feather in the hat

A sharp knife glistens

The fire crackles loud

Whispers in the dark

The train whistle blows

The hat stays on

Blood stains the dust

Ride hard ride fast

Keep your gun loaded

The last bullet counts

Pistols spin with ease

The prairie dog watches

A cowboy never quits

The mustang runs free

The cattle keep moving

The sheriff dont blink

A bandana covers dust

A stranger in town

The well runs dry

Boots echo on wood

The barn door creaks

The gambler never folds

Cigar smoke drifts high

A shot breaks silence

The lone wolf waits

The whiskey runs out

A rattler in the grass

The dust wont settle

A hat blown away

Gunslinger walks away

The outlaws last breath

Riding under the stars

The fire glows warm

Rain falls on leather

A deal made quick

The colt still smokes

The canyon echoes loud
